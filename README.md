# Attacking-and-Defending-AWS
Gained hands-on experience with common security weaknesses around the most commonly used AWS services and covered mitigations to help in securing these services.
Key Learnings 🧠
1. IAM Permissions and Credentials 🔑
Long-term Credentials: Created via the AWS Console or AWS CLI using commands like aws iam create-access-key.
Short-term Credentials: Generated by AWS Security Token Service (STS) using commands like aws sts get-session-token.
Best Practices:
Avoid using IAM Users when possible; prefer SAML or OIDC for session credentials.
Never commit access keys to source code repositories.
Rotate access keys regularly and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
2. Resource Policies and Service Control Policies (SCPs) 📜
IAM Policies: Define what actions a principal can perform on resources.
Resource Policies: Attached to resources (e.g., S3 buckets) to define who can access them.
SCPs: Applied at the organizational level to enforce compliance and security policies across accounts.
3. AWS Services and Security ☁️
AWS Lambda: Explored security implications of serverless functions, including execution roles and resource-based policies.
S3 Buckets: Learned about public S3 buckets, their naming conventions, and how to identify misconfigured buckets.
EC2 Instances: Gained insights into launching and managing EC2 instances, including security group configurations and IAM roles.
4. VPC and Networking 🌐
VPC Components: Understood the structure of VPCs, including subnets, route tables, and security groups.
NAT Gateways and VPC Endpoints: Learned how to manage internet access for private subnets and secure communication with AWS services.
5. Monitoring and Logging 📊
VPC Flow Logs: Used for monitoring network traffic and identifying potential security threats.
AWS GuardDuty: A threat detection service that uses machine learning to identify suspicious activity.
6. Hands-On Labs 🛠️
Engaged in practical labs that involved:
Creating IAM users and roles.
Configuring access keys and environment variables.
Exploring and exploiting public S3 buckets.
Using tools like FireProx for IP rotation in API requests.
Conclusion 🎉
This training has not only equipped me with valuable skills but also reinforced my commitment to continuous learning in cybersecurity and cloud computing. I am excited to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios and contribute to secure cloud architectures
